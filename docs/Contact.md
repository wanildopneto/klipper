I have a question about Klipper
===============================

Unfortunately, we receive many more questions than we could possibly
answer. We did our best to provide answers to common questions in the
[Klipper documentation](Overview.md). Please take the time to read the
documentation and follow the directions provided there.

Many questions we receive are general 3d-printing questions that are
not specific to Klipper. If you have a general question or are
experiencing general printing problems, then you will likely get a
better response by asking in a general 3d-printing forum or a forum
dedicated to your printer hardware.

If you are interested in sharing your knowledge and experience with
other Klipper users then you can join the
[Klipper Community Discord](#discord). It is a community where Klipper
users can discuss Klipper with other users.

Do not open a Klipper github issue to ask a question.

I have a feature request
========================

All new features require someone interested and able to implement that
feature. If you are interested in helping to implement or test a new
feature, you can inquire about ongoing developments in the
[Klipper Community Discord](#discord).

Unfortunately, if no one is currently working on a feature, then it is
unlikely to be implemented in the near future. We only track features
that are under active development.

Do not open a Klipper github issue to request a feature.

Help! It doesn't work!
======================

Unfortunately, we receive many more requests for help than we could
possibly answer. Most problem reports we see are eventually tracked
down to:
1. Subtle errors in the hardware, or
2. Not following all the steps described in the Klipper documentation.

If you are experiencing problems we recommend you carefully read the
[Klipper documentation](Overview.md) and double check that all steps
were followed.

If you are experiencing a printing problem, then we recommend
carefully inspecting the printer hardware (all joints, wires, screws,
etc.) and verify nothing is abnormal. We find most printing problems
are not related to the Klipper software. You may get a better response
by searching in a general 3d-printing forum or in a forum dedicated to
your printer hardware.

If you are interested in sharing your knowledge and experience with
other Klipper users then you can join the
[Klipper Community Discord](#discord). It is a community where Klipper
users can discuss Klipper with other users.

Do not open a Klipper github issue to request help.

I would like to share the findings of work that I have done
===========================================================

We use Github as a location for collaborators that are working on
improving Klipper to share the results of their work. If you have done
some interesting research then you can share the results of your work
using the Github issue tracker.

Note, that the Klipper Github is not a place to ask a question and it
is not a place to make requests.

The Klipper Github issue tracker is at:
[https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/issues](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/issues)

Another option is to share your results using the
[Klipper Community Discord](#discord). It is a community where Klipper
users can discuss Klipper with other users.

I found a bug in Klipper
========================

Klipper is an open-source project and we appreciate when collaborators
provide bug reports.

There is important information that will be needed in order to fix a
bug. Please follow these steps:
1. Be sure the bug is in the Klipper software. If you are thinking
   "there is a problem, I can't figure out why, and therefore it is a
   Klipper bug", then **do not** open a github issue. In that case,
   someone interested and able will need to first research and
   diagnose the root cause of the problem. If you would like to share
   the results of your research and check if other users are
   experiencing similar issues then you can join the
   [Klipper Community Discord](#discord) and inquire there.
2. Make sure you are running unmodified code from
   [https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper).
   If the code has been modified or is obtained from another source,
   then you will need to reproduce the problem on the unmodified code
   from
   [https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper)
   prior to reporting an issue.
3. If possible, run an `M112` command in the OctoPrint terminal window
   immediately after the undesirable event occurs. This causes Klipper
   to go into a "shutdown state" and it will cause additional
   debugging information to be written to the log file.
4. Obtain the Klipper log file from the event. The log file has been
   engineered to answer common questions the Klipper developers have
   about the software and its environment (software version, hardware
   type, configuration, event timing, and hundreds of other
   questions).
   1. The Klipper log file is located in `/tmp/klippy.log` on the
      Klipper "host" computer (the Raspberry Pi).
   2. An "scp" or "sftp" utility is needed to copy this log file to
      your desktop computer. The "scp" utility comes standard with
      Linux and MacOS desktops. There are freely available scp
      utilities for other desktops (eg, WinSCP). If using a graphical
      scp utility that can not directly copy `/tmp/klippy.log` then
      repeatedly click on `..` or `parent folder` until you get to the
      root directory, click on the `tmp` folder, and then select the
      `klippy.log` file.
   3. Copy the log file to your desktop so that it can be attached to
      an issue report.
   4. Do not modify the log file in any way; do not provide a snippet
      of the log. Only the full unmodified log file provides the
      necessary information.
   5. If the log file is very large (eg, greater than 2MB) then one
      may need to compress the log with zip or gzip.
5. Open a new github issue at
   [https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/issues](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/issues)
   and provide a clear description of the problem. The Klipper
   developers need to understand what steps were taken, what the
   desired outcome was, and what outcome actually occurred. The
   Klipper log file **must be attached** to that ticket:

I am making changes that I'd like to include in Klipper
=======================================================

Klipper is open-source software and we appreciate new contributions.

New contributions (for both code and documentation) are submitted via
Github Pull Requests. See the [CONTRIBUTING document](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for important information.

There are several
[documents for developers](Overview.md#developer-documentation). If
you have questions on the code then you can also ask on the
[Klipper Community Discord](#discord). If you would like to provide an
update on your current progress then you can open a Github issue with
the location of your code, an overview of the changes, and a
description of its current status.
